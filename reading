> ng new users-followers

> added a form in html

REFER 

<form #varName="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)">
    <input type="text" name="someName" [(ngModel)]="inputName" />
</form>

every input must have a name attribute that can be anything meaningful
and value of [(ngModel)] must be the name defined in the class, ie 'inputName'
must be defined.

YOU GOT AN ERROR SAYING, 'NO PROVIDER FOR Http in AppComponent'

this is due to the speling mistake
import {Http} from '@angular/http';//--> here you need to mention small 'http' not 'Http'
