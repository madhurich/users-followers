<form #varName="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)">
    <input type="text" name="someName" [(ngModel)]="inputName" />
</form>

every input must have a name attribute that can be anything meaningful
and value of [(ngModel)] must be the name defined in the class, ie 'inputName'
must be defined.

YOU GOT AN ERROR SAYING, 'NO PROVIDER FOR Http in AppComponent'

this is due to the speling mistake
import {Http} from '@angular/http';//--> here you need to mention small 'http' not 'Http'

-----
you got a WARNING, whne you did 
import {Observable} from 'rxjs/observable';//-->THIS IS WRONG

DO THIS import {Observable} from 'rxj/Rx';
----
Earlier you used multiple get methods to retrieve, users and their repos
and stored the result in different varibales. But later you used forkJoin
that joins the result of both the observables(usercall and repos call).
